# sabayon-atom
My Sabayon repository for Atom with ebuilds to install Atom from binary packages. Using these tools I also build a `.tbz2` package that I upload to my dropbox. You can install these packages, after you download them, of course, by running (as root):
```sh
emerge -av atom-bin-x.y.z.tbz2
```
where `x.y.z` are, of course, replaced with the version of the package you downloaded. 

Here are the `.tbz2` file link(s) thus far:
