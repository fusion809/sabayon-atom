Title: Calamares graphical bug in Sabayon MATE 15.11

Hi,

I have noticed that during the installation phase of Sabayon MATE, Calamares became invisible after I pressed "Next" at the Summary stage. Now I have labelled this bug as major, instead of as a blocker or critical, because it didn't stop me from installing Sabayon MATE. Here (http://imgur.com/ISkO11E) is a screenshot showing the Calamares bug. While here (http://i.imgur.com/VRmu7RH.png) is where I got to before the bug revealed itself.

You may notice in this screenshot that I ran Calamares from the MATE Terminal (as root, ofc) so I could tell when the Calamares installer was finally finished with installing Sabayon MATE. I also did this to get more debugging info here is what I saw in the MATE Terminal (to get these two files I ran calamares > output.txt 2> output_err.txt as root):

output_err.txt: http://paste2.org/CmkIWbHP

Thanks for your time,
Brenton
